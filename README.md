## VMSnap
Have you ever been working so hard for several days on a specific project, on a specific virtual machine running on your desktop, so hard that you forgot to take snapshots, and then a sudden irreversible crash occurs? I've already experienced this situation a couple of times now, and I can only tell you it can be really painful.
This is a .bat script I wrote (for the first time coding in Batch), which is used to automate the task of taking snapshots of a virtual machine running on a Windows host (>7).
